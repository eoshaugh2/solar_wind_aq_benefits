# solar_wind_aq_benefits


This folder contains data and scripts to replicate the methodology described in “Climate and air quality benefits of wind and solar generation in the United Sates, 2019-2022.” The folder contains four sub-folders.

Data
Data inputs required to implement analyses (see further notes about data in Scripts)

Figures
A folder where figures will be generated, all figures in the manuscript are here

Outputs
A folder to store outputs generated by the scripts

Scripts
Folder contains all scripts used in the analysis. This replication packages emphasizes replication of the analysis of the compiled data. The Scripts folder contains a sub-folder “Data gen” that provides templates for pulling open-source data. Those scripts provide information on how future analysts can pull fresh data. Those raw data inputs are not provided in the Data folder, but all raw data inputs are publicly available. The Data gen scripts should be used as a reference, but the primary replication scripts begin sequentially with 1_generation_regressions, 2_results_compile, and 3_results_compile_national. The remaining scripts generate additional outputs and figures building on the outputs of the three sequential scripts.
